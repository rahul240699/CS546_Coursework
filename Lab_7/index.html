            <h2>Singapore</h2>
            <p>
                Singapore, city-state located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, about 85 miles (137 kilometres) north of the Equator. 
                It consists of the diamond-shaped Singapore Island and some 60 small islets; the main island occupies all but about 18 square miles of this combined area. 
                The main island is separated from Peninsular Malaysia to the north by Johor Strait, a narrow channel crossed by a road and rail causeway that is more than half a mile long. 
                The southern limits of the state run through Singapore Strait, where outliers of the Riau-Lingga Archipelago—which forms a part of Indonesia—extend to within 10 miles of the main island.

                I visited Singapore back in Christmas of 2019, It remains one of the best trips I have ever had. 
                The people are very welcoming, polite and happy go lucky.
                The Country despite being a very small country is one of the most highly culture rich places in Asia.

                I have been Living in New York for the past year, and it feels like I am living in a movie.
                NYC is really "the concrete jungle where dreams are made of"
                The city has iconic destinations, beautiful parks, great museums, Broadway and Public transport that can take you to every inch of the city.
                My Favourite Time to visit is Thanksgiving to Christmas period, when the entire city is decorated and there's music everywhere.
